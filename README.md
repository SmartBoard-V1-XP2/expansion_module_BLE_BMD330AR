## Overview
This repository hosts the design and implementation of the BLE BMD330AR Expansion Module. The module integrates the BMD-330-A-R, a Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy module, suitable for a wide range of IoT and automation applications. It connects to the smartboard via a single slot, utilizing four serial port lines: RX, TX, RTS, and CTS, along with two configuration pins.

## Key Features of BMD-330
- **Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy** for efficient wireless communication.
- **200m Range**: Extensive coverage for various applications.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Under 15.4 mA in Tx mode and less than 10 mA in Rx mode.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: SPI, UART, I2C, GPIO, PWM, and PDM.
- **Compact Size**: Measures 14 x 9.8 x 1.9 mm, ideal for embedded solutions.
